Answer: Below are Main features of OOPs in java
1. Abstraction
2. Encapsulation
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism
5. Classes and Objects
6. Method Overriding
7. Method Overloading

Encapsulation
̲Encapsulation means keeping data and the methods that modify that data together within a single unit, and restricting outside access

Abstraction
Abstraction involves showing only the important features of an object while hiding the complex details
ex: The internal details of how each specific animal makes a sound (makeSound() method) are hidden within each subclass (ex.Dog)

Inheritance
Inheritance allows one class to inherit fields and methods from another class

Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon

Method Overriding
Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass

Method Overloading
̲Method overloading allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameters within the same class

Classes and Objects
Classes are blueprints for creating objects, and objects are instances of classes that hold data and methods to manipulate that data
==============================
Difference between Spring Framework and Spring Boot

Spring Framework 
-> Allows to develop apps using 3 types of Configs i.e. xml driven configs, Annotations driven cofigs, 100% code driven configs
-> Programmer explicitly created IOC Container except in Spring MVC application
-> Does not give embedded server. So to run application we need to arrange web server explicitly.
-> Does not give any in-memory databases
-> We need to add dependencies (jar files) manually using gradle/maven
-> Bit lightweight as compared of Spring Boot because of No AutoConfiguratin support

Spring Boot
-> Supports only one type of confgs that is through annotations and giving inputs for autoConfigutaration for application.properties file
-> Programmer does not create IoC Container , rather he gets it by calling SpringApplication.run()
-> Gives Tomcat, Jetty and etc servers as Embedded servers
->Gives in-memory databases like h2
-> Bit heavy weight due to AutoConfiguration support which created Objects which might not even needed
-> Spring boot gives starters which provide main jars, dependent jars and related jars as well.

🚀 Java Interview Prep: Hibernate Essentials
Hibernate is a powerful ORM framework in Java that simplifies database operations, reduces boilerplate code, and boosts performance.

📌 1. What is Hibernate & Why Use It?
Hibernate maps Java objects to database tables, letting you interact without SQL.
✅ Reduces repetitive JDBC code
✅ Supports caching for faster performance
✅ Works across databases

📌 2. How is Hibernate Different from JDBC?
JDBC requires SQL queries and manual database handling.
Hibernate automates mapping and caching for better performance.

📌 3. Key Hibernate Components
✔ SessionFactory – Manages connections
✔ Session – Executes queries
✔ Transaction – Ensures commit/rollback

📌 4. What is HQL?
HQL works on Java objects instead of database tables.
🔹 SQL Example: SELECT * FROM employees;
🔹 HQL Example: FROM Employee

📌 5. What is Caching in Hibernate?
Caching improves query performance.
⚡ First-Level Cache – Default, session-specific.
⚡ Second-Level Cache – Configurable, shared across sessions.

📌 6. Lazy vs. Eager Loading
👉 Lazy Loading – Fetches data only when accessed.
👉 Eager Loading – Fetches all data immediately.
💡 Example:
@OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
@OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.EAGER)

📌 7. How Does Hibernate Handle Transactions?
Hibernate ensures ACID transactions for consistency.
✅ Example:
Session session = sessionFactory.openSession();
Transaction tx = session.beginTransaction();
session.save(employee);
tx.commit();
session.close();

📌 8. Common Hibernate Annotations
@Entity – Marks a class as a database entity
@Table – Maps a class to a table
@Id – Specifies the primary key

📌 9. Hibernate Relationships
✔ @OneToOne – One-to-one
✔ @OneToMany – One-to-many
✔ @ManyToMany – Many-to-many

📌 10. Hibernate Integration with Spring Boot
💡 Add following to application.properties:
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/db
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=root
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true

=================================
Java 8 Streams: Transform, Filter, and Reduce Your Way to Cleaner Code!
Streams enable functional-style programming in Java, allowing us to write cleaner, more readable, and more efficient code. 

💡 Key Methods in Streams :-
 1. map():
Transforms each element in a stream.
Example: Convert a list of names to uppercase.

List<String> names = List.of("John", "Jane");
List<String> upperNames = names.stream()
 .map(String::toUpperCase)
 .toList();

 2. filter():
Filters elements based on a condition.
Example: Get even numbers from a list.

List<Integer> numbers = List.of(1, 2, 3, 4);
List<Integer> evens = numbers.stream()
 .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
 .toList();

 3. flatMap():
Flattens nested structures like lists of lists into a single stream.
Example: Combine lists into one.

List<List<Integer>> listOfLists = List.of(List.of(1, 2), List.of(3, 4));
List<Integer> flatList = listOfLists.stream()
 .flatMap(List::stream)
 .toList();

 4. reduce():
Reduces elements to a single value using an accumulator.
Example: Sum a list of numbers.

List<Integer> numbers = List.of(1, 2, 3, 4);
int sum = numbers.stream()
 .reduce(0, Integer::sum);

 5. forEach():
Iterates through elements for side-effects (e.g., printing).
Example: Print all elements in a list.

List<String> names = List.of("John", "Jane");
names.stream().forEach(System.out::println);

🌟 Why Use Streams?
 • Readable Code: Concise and expressive.
 • Efficient Processing: Streams are lazy; operations are only executed when needed.
 • Parallel Processing: With .parallelStream(), you can easily process data in parallel.

1. How to use Lambda expressions and Stream API in Java? 
Can you write a simple example where you filter a list of numbers and find the sum of even numbers using Java Streams?
2. What is the difference between synchronized and volatile in Java? Can you give an example of when each would be used?
3. Can you explain how Spring Boot's auto-configuration mechanism works? How does it help developers to quickly set up an application?
=>a.Spring Boot Starters: 
	-Spring Boot provides starter dependencies (e.g., spring-boot-starter-web, spring-boot-starter-data-jpa) that bundle commonly used libraries for specific functionalities.
	-When you include a starter in your pom.xml or build.gradle, Spring Boot automatically assumes what you might want to configure based on these dependencies.
b.@EnableAutoConfiguration and @SpringBootApplication:
	-The @EnableAutoConfiguration part scans the classpath for available libraries and configures the application based on their presence.
c.Conditional Configuration:
	-Spring Boot's auto-configuration uses conditional annotations (e.g., @ConditionalOnClass, @ConditionalOnMissingBean) to determine whether certain configurations should be applied.
		-If a DataSource bean is not already defined but a HikariCP library is available, Spring Boot configures a default DataSource.
d.Default Properties:
	-Spring Boot provides sensible default configurations for many components.
	-If using an embedded database like H2, Spring Boot sets it up automatically.
Default server settings are applied (e.g., running on port 8080).
e.Customizing Configuration:
	-Developers can override auto-configuration defaults by:
	-Providing custom settings in the application.properties or application.yml file.
f.Auto-Configuration Classes:
	-Spring Boot uses specific configuration classes for auto-configuration, which are listed in the spring.factories file under META-INF/ in the spring-boot-autoconfigure JAR.

4. Can you explain the concept of Dependency Injection (DI) in Spring? How have you used DI in your Spring Boot applications? Can you give an example of constructor-based DI and setter-based DI?
5. How can you expose RESTful services in Spring Boot? Can you walk me through creating a simple REST API with a GET and POST method?

==========================
🚀 Spring Boot Caching

In today’s fast-paced development world, application performance is critical. 
One way to enhance performance is by leveraging Spring Boot Caching, which simplifies adding a caching layer to your application.

Let me break down the key caching annotations Spring Boot provides:

📌 @EnableCaching
Activates caching for your Spring Boot application.

📌 @Cacheable
Caches the result of a method. If the method is called with the same parameters, the cached result is returned, saving processing time.

@Cacheable(value = "books", key = "#id", unless = "#result == null")
public Book getBookById(Long id) {
 return bookRepository.findById(id);
}

📌 @CachePut
Updates the cache with a new value whenever the annotated method is invoked.

@CachePut(value = "books", key = "#book.id")
public Book updateBook(Book book) {
 return bookRepository.save(book);
}

📌 @CacheEvict
Removes entries from the cache to keep data consistent.

@CacheEvict(value = "books", key = "#id")
public void deleteBookById(Long id) {
 bookRepository.deleteById(id);
}

📌 @Caching
Combines multiple cache operations for complex scenarios.


@Caching(
 put = { @CachePut(value = "books", key = "#book.id") },
 evict = { @CacheEvict(value = "allBooks", allEntries = true) }
)
public Book saveBook(Book book) {
 return bookRepository.save(book);
}

📌 @CacheConfig
Reduces redundancy by defining common cache configurations at the class level.

@CacheConfig(cacheNames = "books")
public class BookService {
 @Cacheable(key = "#id")
 public Book getBookById(Long id) {
 return bookRepository.findById(id);
 }
}


1️⃣ Add the Spring Boot cache dependency:

<dependency>
 <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
 <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-cache</artifactId>
</dependency>

2️⃣ Enable caching:

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableCaching
public class Application {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
 }
}

3️⃣ Configure your caching provider (e.g., EhCache, Caffeine, Redis).

By leveraging these annotations, you can seamlessly integrate caching into your Spring Boot application 
and improve performance by reducing redundant computations or database hits.

======================================

𝐍𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐂𝐥𝐚𝐬𝐬𝐞𝐬 𝐢𝐧 𝐉𝐚𝐯𝐚

In Java, a nested class is a class defined within another class. There are 𝐟𝐨𝐮𝐫 types of nested classes:

1) 𝐌𝐞𝐦𝐛𝐞𝐫 𝐈𝐧𝐧𝐞𝐫 𝐂𝐥𝐚𝐬𝐬: A member inner class is a class defined at the same level as other class members. To instantiate it, we must first instantiate the outer class. Member inner classes have access to all members of the outer class, including 𝐩𝐫𝐢𝐯𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐦𝐞𝐦𝐛𝐞𝐫𝐬.

2) 𝐋𝐨𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐈𝐧𝐧𝐞𝐫 𝐂𝐥𝐚𝐬𝐬: A local inner class is a class defined within a method, similar to a local variable. Its scope is limited to the method, and it has access to all members of the enclosing class. However, it can only access 𝐟𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐥 or 𝐞𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐥𝐲 𝐟𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐥 local variables of the enclosing method.

3) 𝐀𝐧𝐨𝐧𝐲𝐦𝐨𝐮𝐬 𝐈𝐧𝐧𝐞𝐫 𝐂𝐥𝐚𝐬𝐬: Anonymous inner classes are inner classes with no name and are declared and instantiated in a single expression. They can extend a class or implement an interface but are limited to one superclass or one interface. Note that 𝐥𝐚𝐦𝐛𝐝𝐚𝐬 introduced in Java 8 serve similar use cases for functional interfaces.

4) 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐜 𝐍𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐂𝐥𝐚𝐬𝐬: Static nested classes are defined with the 𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐜 keyword at the same level as other class members. They can be instantiated without an object of the enclosing class and can only access static members of the outer class.

Mostly asked API interview questions:
Q1.What is the role of headers in API testing?
Answer: Headers in API testing play an important role in providing additional information that is not included in the request body. Headers are important in controlling the behavior of the server in handling the request, providing authentication information, or providing metadata about the request or response.

Q2.What is the purpose of the request and response headers in API testing?
Ans: The request headers are used to specify a content type, caching, authentication, sending pdf files, etc. The response header can provide information about the Content Details, Authentication Status, Rate Limiting(Notify the client about API usage limits Example: X-RateLimit-Remaining: 100.), server, caching, etc.

Q3.How do you prioritize API test cases for regression testing?
Ans: 1. Select test cases with frequent defects.
2. Select test cases with critical functionalities.
3. Select test cases with frequent code changes.
4 . Cover end-to-end test flows.
5 . Select a risk-based testing approach.
6. Test Endpoints With High Traffic (ex: Search, user profile fetching, or real-time notification APIs.
7 . Validate Integration Points.(Focus on APIs with multiple dependencies or integrations with external services, as these have a higher chance of failing due to external changes.

7. Your Jenkins pipeline is set to poll GitHub every 5 minutes for changes. However, there are delays in triggering new builds. How can you optimize Jenkins to trigger builds instantly on code changes?

8. A merge request triggers the Jenkins pipeline, but the build fails due to a merge conflict. How would you handle this scenario programmatically in Jenkins?

9. A deployment fails in production due to a bug. You need to quickly revert to the last successful build. What Jenkins pipeline steps would you implement to enable easy rollbacks? CI/CD Pipeline with Build Tools (Maven, Gradle, npm)

10. Your Maven build is failing due to a missing dependency.
Question: How would you modify your Jenkins pipeline to resolve this issue and ensure dependency availability?

🔹 Core Java & Collections
• Difference between == and equals()
• How does HashMap work internally?
– hashing, buckets, collision handling
– what changed after Java 8 (treeification)

🔹 Java 8 – Concepts & Features
• What features were introduced in Java 8?
• What is a functional interface? Can you name a few?
• What is a lambda expression?
• What is the difference between map() and filter()?
• Difference between map() and flatMap()
• What are method references and when would you use them?
• What is Optional and why was it introduced?
• How do Streams work internally?
• Difference between intermediate and terminal operations

🔹 Coding Questions (Java 8 Mandatory)
1️. Find the 2nd most repeated character in a string
Example:
"aaaabbccbdd" → b

2️. Print the series using Java 8 only
11, 12, 15, 20, 27

3️⃣ Using Java 8, group words by their length
Example:
["java", "spring", "boot", "api"]
Output:
{3=[api], 4=[java, boot], 6=[spring]}

Spring Boot Tricky Questions – Part 2 (Interview Edition)

Spring Boot interviews don’t fail you on basics — they fail you on internals.
Here are more “wait… why?” questions that interviewers love 👇

• What happens if two @Configuration classes define the same bean name?
• Why does @Transactional silently fail in self-invocation scenarios?
• How does Spring Boot decide which auto-configuration to back off?
• What breaks if you mark a @Bean method as static?
• Why does @Async sometimes run synchronously?
• What happens when multiple @Primary beans exist?
• How does Spring Boot resolve property precedence at runtime?
• Can you override auto-configured beans without disabling auto-config?
