Java Shorts: 🚀 Spring Boot Caching

In today’s fast-paced development world, application performance is critical. One way to enhance performance is by leveraging Spring Boot Caching, which simplifies adding a caching layer to your application.

Let me break down the key caching annotations Spring Boot provides:

📌 @EnableCaching

Activates caching for your Spring Boot application.


📌 @Cacheable

Caches the result of a method. If the method is called with the same parameters, the cached result is returned, saving processing time.


@Cacheable(value = "books", key = "#id", unless = "#result == null")
public Book getBookById(Long id) {
 return bookRepository.findById(id);
}

📌 @CachePut

Updates the cache with a new value whenever the annotated method is invoked.


@CachePut(value = "books", key = "#book.id")
public Book updateBook(Book book) {
 return bookRepository.save(book);
}

📌 @CacheEvict

Removes entries from the cache to keep data consistent.


@CacheEvict(value = "books", key = "#id")
public void deleteBookById(Long id) {
 bookRepository.deleteById(id);
}

📌 @Caching

Combines multiple cache operations for complex scenarios.


@Caching(
 put = { @CachePut(value = "books", key = "#book.id") },
 evict = { @CacheEvict(value = "allBooks", allEntries = true) }
)
public Book saveBook(Book book) {
 return bookRepository.save(book);
}

📌 @CacheConfig

Reduces redundancy by defining common cache configurations at the class level.


@CacheConfig(cacheNames = "books")
public class BookService {
 @Cacheable(key = "#id")
 public Book getBookById(Long id) {
 return bookRepository.findById(id);
 }
}

💡 How to Get Started:

1️⃣ Add the Spring Boot cache dependency:

<dependency>
 <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
 <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-cache</artifactId>
</dependency>

2️⃣ Enable caching:

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableCaching
public class Application {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
 }
}

3️⃣ Configure your caching provider (e.g., EhCache, Caffeine, Redis).

By leveraging these annotations, you can seamlessly integrate caching into your Spring Boot application and improve performance by reducing redundant computations or database hits.

𝐍𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐂𝐥𝐚𝐬𝐬𝐞𝐬 𝐢𝐧 𝐉𝐚𝐯𝐚

In Java, a nested class is a class defined within another class. There are 𝐟𝐨𝐮𝐫 types of nested classes:

1) 𝐌𝐞𝐦𝐛𝐞𝐫 𝐈𝐧𝐧𝐞𝐫 𝐂𝐥𝐚𝐬𝐬: A member inner class is a class defined at the same level as other class members. To instantiate it, we must first instantiate the outer class. Member inner classes have access to all members of the outer class, including 𝐩𝐫𝐢𝐯𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐦𝐞𝐦𝐛𝐞𝐫𝐬.

2) 𝐋𝐨𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐈𝐧𝐧𝐞𝐫 𝐂𝐥𝐚𝐬𝐬: A local inner class is a class defined within a method, similar to a local variable. Its scope is limited to the method, and it has access to all members of the enclosing class. However, it can only access 𝐟𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐥 or 𝐞𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐥𝐲 𝐟𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐥 local variables of the enclosing method.

3) 𝐀𝐧𝐨𝐧𝐲𝐦𝐨𝐮𝐬 𝐈𝐧𝐧𝐞𝐫 𝐂𝐥𝐚𝐬𝐬: Anonymous inner classes are inner classes with no name and are declared and instantiated in a single expression. They can extend a class or implement an interface but are limited to one superclass or one interface. Note that 𝐥𝐚𝐦𝐛𝐝𝐚𝐬 introduced in Java 8 serve similar use cases for functional interfaces.

4) 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐜 𝐍𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐂𝐥𝐚𝐬𝐬: Static nested classes are defined with the 𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐜 keyword at the same level as other class members. They can be instantiated without an object of the enclosing class and can only access static members of the outer class.
