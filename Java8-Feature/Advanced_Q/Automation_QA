TestNG Cheat Sheet: Annotations and Attributes Made Simple.

Want better control over your test execution? Hereâ€™s a quick breakdown of TestNG annotations and attributes to supercharge your testing:

ðŸ”¹Core Annotations

 â€¢ @BeforeSuite: Runs before all tests in a suite.
 â€¢ @BeforeClass: Runs before the first test in a class.
 â€¢ @BeforeMethod: Executes before each test method.
 â€¢ @Test: Marks a method as a test case.
 â€¢ @AfterMethod, @AfterClass, @AfterSuite: Handle post-test cleanup.

ðŸ”¹Execution Control

 â€¢ Sequential Execution: Runs tests one after another.
 â€¢ Parallel Execution: Use XML configurations for faster parallel test runs.

ðŸ”¹TestNG Attributes (Inside @Test)

 â€¢ priority: Decide the test execution order.
 â€¢ invocationCount: Repeat a test multiple times.
 â€¢ invocationTimeOut: Set a time limit for execution.
 â€¢ dependsOnMethods: Run tests in a specific sequence.
 â€¢ alwaysRun: Ensures execution even if dependencies fail.
 â€¢ enabled: Skip tests by setting it to false.

ðŸ”¹Example:

@Test(priority = 1, invocationCount = 3, dependsOnMethods = "previousTest", alwaysRun = true, enabled = false) 
public void testMethod() { 
 // Test logic here 
} 

Use these tips to make your TestNG scripts clean, efficient, and powerful.
