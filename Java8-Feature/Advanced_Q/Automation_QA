TestNG Cheat Sheet: Annotations and Attributes Made Simple.

Want better control over your test execution? Here‚Äôs a quick breakdown of TestNG annotations and attributes to supercharge your testing:

üîπCore Annotations

 ‚Ä¢ @BeforeSuite: Runs before all tests in a suite.
 ‚Ä¢ @BeforeClass: Runs before the first test in a class.
 ‚Ä¢ @BeforeMethod: Executes before each test method.
 ‚Ä¢ @Test: Marks a method as a test case.
 ‚Ä¢ @AfterMethod, @AfterClass, @AfterSuite: Handle post-test cleanup.

üîπExecution Control

 ‚Ä¢ Sequential Execution: Runs tests one after another.
 ‚Ä¢ Parallel Execution: Use XML configurations for faster parallel test runs.

üîπTestNG Attributes (Inside @Test)

 ‚Ä¢ priority: Decide the test execution order.
 ‚Ä¢ invocationCount: Repeat a test multiple times.
 ‚Ä¢ invocationTimeOut: Set a time limit for execution.
 ‚Ä¢ dependsOnMethods: Run tests in a specific sequence.
 ‚Ä¢ alwaysRun: Ensures execution even if dependencies fail.
 ‚Ä¢ enabled: Skip tests by setting it to false.

üîπExample:

@Test(priority = 1, invocationCount = 3, dependsOnMethods = "previousTest", alwaysRun = true, enabled = false) 
public void testMethod() { 
 // Test logic here 
} 

Use these tips to make your TestNG scripts clean, efficient, and powerful.
