TestNG Cheat Sheet: Annotations and Attributes Made Simple.

Want better control over your test execution? Here’s a quick breakdown of TestNG annotations and attributes to supercharge your testing:

🔹Core Annotations

 • @BeforeSuite: Runs before all tests in a suite.
 • @BeforeClass: Runs before the first test in a class.
 • @BeforeMethod: Executes before each test method.
 • @Test: Marks a method as a test case.
 • @AfterMethod, @AfterClass, @AfterSuite: Handle post-test cleanup.

🔹Execution Control

 • Sequential Execution: Runs tests one after another.
 • Parallel Execution: Use XML configurations for faster parallel test runs.

🔹TestNG Attributes (Inside @Test)

 • priority: Decide the test execution order.
 • invocationCount: Repeat a test multiple times.
 • invocationTimeOut: Set a time limit for execution.
 • dependsOnMethods: Run tests in a specific sequence.
 • alwaysRun: Ensures execution even if dependencies fail.
 • enabled: Skip tests by setting it to false.

🔹Example:

@Test(priority = 1, invocationCount = 3, dependsOnMethods = "previousTest", alwaysRun = true, enabled = false) 
public void testMethod() { 
 // Test logic here 
} 

Use these tips to make your TestNG scripts clean, efficient, and powerful.

𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐢𝐬 𝐓𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐍𝐆?
TestNG (Test Next Generation) is a testing framework inspired by JUnit and NUnit but with more powerful features. 

𝐖𝐡𝐲 𝐃𝐨 𝐖𝐞 𝐍𝐞𝐞𝐝 𝐓𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐍𝐆?
- Flexible Annotations: Organize test code efficiently with annotations like @Test, @BeforeMethod, and @AfterMethod.
- Parallel Testing: Run tests in parallel to save time, essential for large projects.
- Data-Driven Testing: Easily test with multiple data sets using the @DataProvider annotation.
- Test Configuration: Customize test execution with configurable suites, groups, and dependencies.
- Reporting: Generate detailed HTML and XML reports for better insights.
Seamless Integration: Works well with build tools like Maven and Gradle, and supports CI/CD pipelines for continuous testing.

𝐇𝐨𝐰 𝐭𝐨 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐓𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐍𝐆 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐒𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐧𝐢𝐮𝐦 𝐉𝐚𝐯𝐚?
1. Add TestNG Dependency:
 - If your Maven Project, add the following dependency in your `pom.xml` file:
 
 <dependency>
 <groupId>org.testng</groupId>
 <artifactId>testng</artifactId>
 <version>7.8.0</version>
 <scope>test</scope>
 </dependency>

2. Create a Test Class:
 - Write a Selenium test case inside a class and annotate the test method with `@Test`.

3. Run the Test:
 - Right-click on the test class in your IDE and choose `Run As > TestNG Test`.
 - Alternatively, create a TestNG XML file to define your test suite and run it.

𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐓𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐍𝐆 𝐇𝐨𝐨𝐤𝐬?
TestNG hooks are special annotations that define the order in which test methods, configuration methods, and suites are executed. 
These hooks include:

1. @BeforeSuite / @AfterSuite: Executed before/after all tests in the suite.
2. @BeforeTest / @AfterTest: Executed before/after the test tag in the XML file.
3. @BeforeClass / @AfterClass: Executed before/after the first method in the class is invoked.
4. @BeforeMethod / @AfterMethod: Executed before/after each test method in the class.
5. @BeforeGroups / @AfterGroups: Executed before/after specified groups of tests run.
6. @BeforeClass / @AfterClass: Executed once before/after the first/last method in the current class.
